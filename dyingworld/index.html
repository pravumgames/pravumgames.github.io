        The game takes place in the alternative universe where during the WW2,
        first artificial intelligence was created. In 2019, Artmind Corporation,
        the leaders of hardware manufacturing and machine learning, creates the
        most powerful supercomputer, to host a self learning algorithm that was
        given a local name “Howard”, to teach itself how to produce more
        efficient copies of said AI. It shows excellent results, and in 2021
        after dozens of hours of learning, it plans the first ever, fully
        machine made space mission to get resources, in order to create second
        generation of itself. After that, in only 3 months, it breaks all known
        methods of encryption, and this leads to unexpected consequences.

      <h1 style="margin-top: 100px;">GAMEPLAY</h1>
      <p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 16px auto">
        Dyingworld is a first person shooter and slasher game, where players
        take a role as a member of rebels or as a cold blooded machine tasked
        with killing humans.
      </p>
      <h3>WAVE-BASED PROGRESSION</h3>
      <p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 16px auto">
        After defeating a wave of foes, you will have some time to find a better
        weapon and think of new tactics, or to disable one of the AI's
        subsystems to gain advantage in a second round. After the certain amount
        of time given for preparation, the another generation of troops will be
        deployed, but this time, they will be upgraded based on tactics in a
        previous round.
      </p>
      <h3>FIRST PERSON SLASHER/SHOOTER</h3>
      <p style="max-width: 1000px; margin: 16px auto">
        The game offers lots of ways for destroying robots (or dismembering
        humans). Game's weapon system is built the way that you can use every
        prop laying on the ground as an effective melee. But for lovers of
        shooting, we have a variety of firearms for you to impale your foe with
        lead!
