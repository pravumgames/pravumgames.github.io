		<h1>About team</h1>
		<p style="max-width: 800px;">
We're group of people that was formed by Daniel Nesov and Piotr Horak. We are newcomers to serious game development, but we all had previous experiences in the past. 

Being driven only by motivation, we're developing our first game: Dyingworld. 
Our goal is to prove that making a quality game is possible for anyone, no matter the age or team size. We want to make a game, that will be completely free, without micro transactions, and which will be enjoyable. We won't release it, until we will enjoy it ourselves. 

We think that gameplay and story are more important than visuals. Worlds we create are not always pleasing to the eye and ears, but we can guarantee that they're unique and well written. 

Our team consists of several highly talented people, that weren't able to show their potential. Now they can.

Cities are being monitored by advanced AI, and our race is being treated as slaves: everyone who doesn't work on the factories is being considered as a "obsolete", and the fate of those is unknown.</p>
