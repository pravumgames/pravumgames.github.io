                They want freedom, at all costs. Chances of winning against the
                city are near zero, but they will not give up. When you play as
                Rebel, try to find a lot of medical supplies and weapons. Since
                you are not ready for combat, because you were ordinary
                civilians, you will need to upgrade your skills and experience
                mental illnesses.
