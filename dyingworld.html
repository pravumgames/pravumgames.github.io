        <h2 style="color:white;font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size:40px; font-weight: lighter;">Welcome to a
            new world.</h2>
        <span style="color:white;font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 20px">Dyingworld is a first person
            roleplaying game, set in alternative world, where totalitarianism was spread through the rest of the world.
            <br> Cities are being monitored by a one big artificial intelligence.</span>
        <h2 style="color:white;font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size:40px; font-weight: lighter;">Gameplay</h2>
        <span style="color:white;font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
            Each team has unique tasks to accomplish, except Neutrals. Neutrals are ordinary dwellers of the city that
            can live and work, like in real life.<br><br>
            Criminals are the bad guys for Police, obviously. They can team up with Neutrals, to get advantage. <br>
            Their task is to take control over city, kill every member of Police or destroy CAI. Police will win only
            when every member of Criminals is arrested or neutralised.<br><br>
            Police is self explanatory. Their task is to prevent Criminals to sell drugs and destroying the CAI. <br>
            If there will be no alive Police members, they will be given the last opportunity to be spawned as a RSS.
            As RSS, they will have 10x greater advantage. <br> As mentioned before, Police will win if every member of
            Criminals is neutralised or arrested.
