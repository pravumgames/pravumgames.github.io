      <p style="max-width: 600px; margin: 16px auto">
Year 2025, dark age of humanity. We're entering the technological singularity, but the cost of human's freedom. Cities are being monitored by advanced AI, and our race is being treated as slaves: everyone who doesn't work on the factories is being considered as a "obsolete", and the fate of those is unknown. In this multiplayer game, you have the chance to play as a member of two teams: "Messiahs" or "City", both are the enemies of each other. Goal of first ones is to free us from this hell. And the second one, well, doesn't like what they try to achieve. Players are also given the opportunity to explore the world. Almost every piece of rubbish on the floor can contain important information about the past of the game.

                They want freedom, at all costs. Chances of winning against the
                city are near zero, but they will not give up. When you play as
                Rebel, try to find a lot of medical supplies and weapons. Since
                you are not ready for combat, because you were ordinary
                civilians, you will need to upgrade your skills and experience
                mental illnesses.
